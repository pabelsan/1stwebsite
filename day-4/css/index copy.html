    <div class="div2">25th Edition | 26 January – 4 February 2024</div>

    <div class="div3">CTM Festival`s 25th anniversary edition will take place January 26 to February 4, 2024. Under the theme »Sustain,« CTM presents the current state of adventurous music, from pulsating dance floor to shared moments of artistic intimacy, and passes through a range of Berlin venues such as Berghain, silent green, radialsystem, OXI, RSO.Berlin, and Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz.</div>

    <p>CTM 2024 is titled »Sustain« – a fascinating word that touches opposite polarities of our contemporary experience as it speaks of the empathy and determination that nourish us, as well as of our anxieties, losses, and pains. In the word »sustain« we sense both what we are going through while hearing what needs to be done. What if sustain were a sound?</p>
    <h2>New Acts & Programme Updates</h2>
    <p>A new list of artists have joined our 25th edition as a number of artists have withdrawn from this year’s festival. Therefore our programme has undergone some changes. Consult the CTM 2024 Festival Schedule to view the full 10-day programme, or our Artist Listing. Note that due to popular demand, a second Organ concert by Kali Malone has been added, on 2 Feb 2024 at the storied Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (not included in festival passes). Festival passes and tickets remain on sale in limited quantities.</p>
    <h2>Fundraising at CTM 2024</h2>
    <p>Over the past 10 years CTM has collected donations for a variety of causes and organisations. In light of the catastrophic Israel-Gaza war this year we will collect donations for Save the Children and for ALLMEP – the Alliance for Middle East Peace. Fundraising at CTM is done in partnership with both organisations. Read all details here.</p>
    <h2>On CTM's 25th Edition</h2>
    <p>For an independent initiative dedicated to experimental and fringe forms of music and art, sustaining over a quarter century is an achievement in itself. Such an anniversary becomes even more profound in light of the many challenges in recent years and the ongoing crises which have called into question and unsettled many, often already false, certitudes – sparing neither music nor nightlife.</p>
    <p>CTM’s 25th anniversary is furthermore a time to reflect on 25 years of collaboration alongside sister festival transmediale, festival for art and digital culture. The first festival edition took place in 1999 as »club transmediale« at the now long demolished club Maria am Ostbahnhof, when CTM’s founders saw a gap adjacent to transmediale, and sought to fill it with a series of experimental club nights that intertwined sonic experiments and underground dance culture with contemporary media art. Titled 10 Tage an der Schnittstelle von Klang / bewegtem Bild (10 days at the intersection of sound / moving image), this first edition gradually expanded and took the shape of the international platform that is CTM Festival today. Over the years, the sister festivals have produced and co-commissioned works and presented collaborative concerts and events, and this year is no exception. Our collaboration will take place in three parts, with the multi-sensory installation »Oceanic Refractions,« a collaborative night at Berghain Säule with GASH collective, and with the Vorspiel programme run by independent Berlin art initiatives. We invite you to read a short history of the festival and browse the CTM Festival edition archive from 1999 to 2023, complete with full artist listings, links to selected recordings, plus recent and archival images of performances, spaces, and club vibes then and now.</p>

        <h2>CTM 2024 on YouTube</h2>
        <p>A selection of performances and talks are available to watch via our YouTube channel. The MusicMaker's Hacklab Finale took place on the festival's final day and featured the result of an intense collaborative work-week where participants selected via open call came together to realise new music and performance ideas. The Research Networking Day assembled nine students and researchers in fields traversing music and related fields, that gave short presentations on their work relating to the festival theme of Sustain.</p>
